									<h3 class="major">Red Team Assessment</h3>
									<p>At LeeCyberSec, our world class penetration testing security consults are battle-tested on the front lines every day. We deliver comprehensive security intelligence that lowers risk, prioritizes solutions, and minimizes business disruptions. Whether testing for security vulnerabilities or exploiting them, our teams have the expertise, ingenuity, and integrity to uphold your trust and put your mind at ease.</p>
										
										<p>Real attacks will be aware of your counter measures. They will look for the backdoors, less observed routes, the unexpected entry points. They will come over the roof, through the tunnels and from the air. They will be believable, credible and will hold up under examination. They will have a history, a purpose and even the ability to explain their presence.</p>
										<p>Red Team security testing provides you with a method of testing these scenarios. Not just what threats would be successful but also how well equipped your company is to detect, react and block such attempts</p>
										<p>Red Team exercises often operate over an extended time and combine multi-faceted testing approaches that are designed to not only seek to penetrate an organization but verify the response, monitoring and incident response investigation process and actions.</p>
										<p>It includes physical security testing, social engineering, 3rd party relationships, hacking, malware insertion, pivoting and human manipulation. It looks at the response, detection, success rates and the defense failures. It gives you remediation advice, threat protection strategies and a route to more robust information assurance.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Web Application Assessment</h3>
									<p> LeeCyberSec provides cutting edge advice and guidance on how to improve the security of your web application software through our specialist web application testing consultants. Through using manual security testing we are able to identify vulnerabilities across all of the OWASP Top 10. We also provide much deeper application logic assessments and assurance for applications hosted internally as well in the cloud. In many instances, we provide software development guidance to fix application vulnerabilities or write input validation controls to protect the environment from malicious internet users.</p>
										<p>As the number of internet web pages exceeds 50 billion, it is evident that more and more data is being taken online. With the advent of BIG data, organizations are able to capture information across a vast array of resources. From capturing analytics on users spending patterns through to tracking users ‘likes’, BIG data is transforming our ability to work, play and communicate.</p>
										<p>The uniform approach for presenting this data is through a web browsers or web enabled app. Vulnerabilities such as Heartbleed have required IT professionals to take a deeper look at the way data is secured. As applications become more complex and deliver more functionality to users, so the opportunity for vulnerability become all the more prevalent and the need for web application testing becomes essential to protect the software IP, the users information and the reputation of the product owner.</p>
											<a href="#" class="special">Top</a>
									
									<h3 class="major">Social Engineering Assessment</h3>
									<p>The phrase Social Engineering; covers a multitude of different types of tests, ranging from services conducted over the Internet, through to services over the phone or physically on site.We strongly believes that an element of Social Engineering should be conducted in all Penetration Tests, due to the fact that humans are involved in all security processes.</p>
										<p>To focus on the technology alone, results in an incomplete test. The intent behind a Penetration Test should be to identify the risk that is presented by a certain type of asset, connection or activity. Therefore to fully address all of the elements that feed into that risk, Nettitude genuinely believe that human aspects need to be considered.</p>
										<p>The Human element will always pose a risk to organizations, however through considered social engineering and targeted security training, organizations can help to reduce the risk of employees exploited through malicious content.</p>
